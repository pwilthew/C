# try_complex is a Unix shell script that will be used to test project 5, problem #2.
# To use the script, copy it into the same directory as your scource file
# Set execute permission for the file by issuing the command:
# chmod +x try_complex
# Compile your program, producing a.out as the executable
# To run the script, type 
# ./try_complex
# The user input from the script will not be shown on the screen.
# Compare the results from your program with the expected results on the test cases.
